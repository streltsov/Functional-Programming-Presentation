    “Java is the most distressing thing to happen to computing since MS-DOS.”

    - Alan Kay, the inventor of Object-Oriented Programming

Good programmers write good code and bad programmers write bad code, no matter the programming paradigm. However, the programming paradigm should constrain bad programmers from doing too much damage. Of course, this is not you since you already are reading this article and putting in the effort to learn. Bad programmers never have the time to learn, they only keep pressing buttons on the keyboard like crazy. Whether you like it or not, you will be working with bad programmers, some who will be really, really bad. And, unfortunately, OOP does not have enough constraints in place that would prevent bad programmers from doing too much damage.
